# Fishcake Project Documentation

Welcome to the official repository for Fishcake project documentation! Here, you will find comprehensive guides and whitepapers that detail the workings of the Fishcake ecosystem, including our innovative tokenomics, platform functionality, and NFT Pass mining.

Fishcake is an open-source Web3 initiative dedicated to enhancing tokenized economies through incentive-based campaigns. With smart contracts and front-end code open for public review and audited for trust and transparency, we empower businesses and customers to interact directly on tokenized marketing and web3 loyalty management!

**Fishcake Coin (FCC) Highlights**:

-**PoW Mining**: Engage in the ecosystem and mine FCC tokens through participation – a dynamic incentive system supporting growth and sustainability.

-**PoS Staking**: Stake your FCC tokens to earn passive rewards over time. This Proof-of-Stake layer enhances long-term engagement, strengthens network stability, and rewards holders for their continued support.

-**Redemption Pool**: The Fishcake redemption pool is a USDT-backed reserve that anchors the value of FCC by maintaining a minimum floor price. This "burn-to-redeem" mechanism not only instills confidence in FCC's long-term stability but also enables holders to share in lifetime dividends generated from all Fishcake revenue streams — positioning each FCC holder as a real shareholder in the ecosystem. 

Fishcake is where technology meets community, making token values real and tangible for everyone.
